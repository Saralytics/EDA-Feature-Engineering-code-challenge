# This Project

# Summary

## Data 

#### 1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

1.1 Basic statistics

1.2 Column without meaning / constant value

1.3 Categorical variables: Distinct columns values

1.4 Continuous variables: Plotting distributions

#### 2. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (functions)

2.1 Handle Missing Values 

2.2 Handle outliers

2.3 Drop features 

2.4 Text processing 

2.5 Encoding categorical variables 


#### 3. Answering the challenges
#### 4. Tests

## Proposed Deployment
Use git-based CI/CD pipeline 

Orchastration tool:
Airflow is a great tool to manage the schedule and dependencies of pipelines 

Example pipeline in the airflow directory.
Here is what it looks like: <insert picture>

# Considerations

1. Adding sklearn library 
2. Text processing could be more clean
